Here are some release notes I compiled and published for public consumption.
Citrine Python is an open-source Python library used in computational materials
informatics. To compile the notes, I read the pull requests, JIRA tickets, and
design docs associated with each commit message entering the release. Whenever
I needed clarification, I reached out to the lead engineer of that feature or
bugfix. Most questions were answered efficiently over Slack.
