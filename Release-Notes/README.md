Here are some release notes I compiled and published for public consumption:

https://github.com/CitrineInformatics/citrine-python/releases/tag/v1.6.0

(Citrine Python)[https://citrineinformatics.github.io/citrine-python/index.html]
is an open-source Python library used in materials informatics research.
To compile the notes, I read the pull requests, JIRA tickets, and
design docs associated with each commit message entering the release. Whenever
I needed clarification, I reached out to the lead engineer of that feature or
bugfix. Most questions were answered efficiently over Slack.
