Below are two memos that I wrote announcing a long-awaited feature in an open
source, publicly available Python SDK that my last company both maintained and
heavily utilized to deploy certain enterprise integrations. The first memo
describes the feature's arrival and how to use it. The second memo follows up
on additional enhancements.

I removed all references to internal or protected knowledge.
