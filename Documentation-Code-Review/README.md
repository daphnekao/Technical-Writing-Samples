This is a code review of a major documentation change that I participated in
during my last job:

https://github.com/CitrineInformatics/citrine-python/pull/710

My teammate had to update the documentation after adding a
large feature and deprecating several outdated features.
The [code base](https://github.com/CitrineInformatics/citrine-python)
is an open source tool used in materials informatics research.
